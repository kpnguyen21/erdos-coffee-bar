<h3 id="Background">Scenario/ Background</h3>
<li>Nook Café, a coffee shop, seeks to diversify into alcoholic beverages. It is located on the campus of a Southern university, one of the largest and most cosmopolitan cities in the United States. As of February 2025, the city is the fourth most populated city in the US, with diverse cultures and restaurants in the area. The university is the largest in the city, with a total enrollment of 47,980 students in 2024. To diversify into alcohol, Nook Café must extend its opening hours, among other strategic moves. Nook Café intends to attract patrons both on and off campus. </li>

<li>A unique characteristic of the city where Nook Café is located is its limited public transit system. Among the top 5 most populous metro areas, the city had the second-lowest public transit ridership rate in 2019, with only 18 rides per resident, compared to New York City, where people took almost 200 annual rides per resident. Hence, the question of how external patrons would commute to Nook Café may pose a challenge. Above all, external patrons must be motivated enough to travel past competitors to reach Nook Café for alcoholic beverages. </li>

<h3 id="Problem">Define the problem</h3>

Nook Café has established itself as one of the favorite spots on campus for university stakeholders to relax and have coffee. It has existed for eighteen years on campus and has recorded steady growth. However, in 2020, the café recorded a significant decline in sales and profit. The global COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown were responsible for the decline. However, many years after the pandemic and the return to normalcy, Nook Café returned to profitability. Still, sales and profit have remained stagnant, indicating that these business indices have reached their ceiling.

The business reality with Nook Café suggests that we should look beyond the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic for problems mitigating against Nook Café's business growth as the pandemic appears to no longer pose a threat. Our preliminary interview of 10 patrons sited at Nook Café suggests other problems may be responsible for the stagnation of growth. Several coffee shops are located outside the campus but within a radius of 5 miles, competing with Nook Café. In our preliminary study of competition, we noticed a common and emerging trend of hybridity, including coffee and alcohol offerings among the surrounding coffee shops. For example, Double Trouble Caffeine & Cocktails is located 2.6 miles from Nook and offers alcoholic beverages. We concluded that including alcohol in the coffee shop business has become a trend, and it is long overdue for Nook Café to diversify into the alcohol market. The exclusion of Nook from the alcohol market is a problem that contributes to stagnation in business growth.

Nook Café closes at 5 pm every weekday and 2 pm on weekends. We discovered that the competition stays open for extended hours. For example, Cowboy Café, located 3.6 miles from Nook, opens daily between 8 am and 12 am. A challenge for Nook in meeting the competition is that the university does not allow alcohol sales within working hours (9 am – 5 pm). Thus, the option open to Nook is to consider alcohol sales from 5 pm and consider extended opening hours. Our investigation showed that Nook maintains a steady number of patrons during the day but loses them to competition in the tail part of the day. Thus, Nook must achieve improved customer retention in the evening and nighttime.

While it is easy for Nook to enter the alcohol market, it must make extra strategic efforts to achieve competitive differentiation and leverage brand expansion opportunities accompanying diversification into new markets. Since surrounding coffee shops are competing and existing threats, operating in the hybridity of coffee and alcohol, the challenge for Nook is to attain brand and service distinction to draw alcohol consumers and retain them for steady profitability. The apparent question for Nook is how it would stay far away from the madding crowd without losing attraction and patronage.

Nook is located on a large campus with an enrollment of 47,980 in 2024. Besides, it is located in a city adjudged as the 5th largest city in the US. This geographical location means there are tremendous opportunities within the campus and more significant opportunities outside the campus if Nook taps into these external opportunities. Besides, Nook has the strength of maintaining multiple shops on the big campus and has achieved a strong brand image on campus. It can leverage these strengths to tap into opportunities comprising various activities on campus that attract outside vendors to sell alcohol on campus. For example, the campus welcomes over 1000 guests across all sports divisions during the game season. With Nook's opportunities and strength, it must navigate its proposed entry into the alcoholic market cautiously to tap the benefits of a new market.
