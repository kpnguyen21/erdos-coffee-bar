<h3 id="Background">Scenario/ Background</h3>
<li>Nook Café, a coffee shop, seeks to diversify into alcoholic beverages. It is located on the campus of a Southern university, one of the largest and most cosmopolitan cities in the United States. As of February 2025, the city is the fourth most populated city in the US, with diverse cultures and restaurants in the area. The university is the largest in the city, with a total enrollment of 47,980 students in 2024. To diversify into alcohol, Nook Café must extend its opening hours, among other strategic moves. Nook Café intends to attract patrons both on and off campus. </li>

<li>A unique characteristic of the city where Nook Café is located is its limited public transit system. Among the top 5 most populous metro areas, the city had the second-lowest public transit ridership rate in 2019, with only 18 rides per resident, compared to New York City, where people took almost 200 annual rides per resident. Hence, the question of how external patrons would commute to Nook Café may pose a challenge. Above all, external patrons must be motivated enough to travel past competitors to reach Nook Café for alcoholic beverages. </li>
